# Alpha Quantum Language Comprehension

For quantum research and development

## Description
This project aims to develop software that enables alpha quantum physics research to comprehend and interpret human language. The goal is to bridge the gap between complex quantum physics concepts and natural language processing to facilitate better understanding and communication in the field of quantum research.

## Installation
To set up the project for development:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/alpha-quantum.git
   cd alpha-quantum
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the software:

```python
from alpha_quantum import LanguageProcessor

# Initialize the language processor
processor = LanguageProcessor()

# Process a quantum physics related query
query = "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement"
result = processor.process_query(query)

print(result)
```

More detailed examples can be found in the `examples` directory.
